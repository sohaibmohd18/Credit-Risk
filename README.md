# Credit-Risk
## Description
The objective of this problem is to minimize the risk and maximize the profit of a bank. The risk is assessed with the help of a set of attributes of each customer to classify whether a person has a Good Credit or Bad Credit.

There are two types of risks associated with the bank’s decision:
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan i.e., having a good credit risk, then not approving the loan to the person results in a loss of business to the bank.
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan i.e., having a bad credit risk, then approving the loan to the person results in a financial loss to the bank.

The dataset is picked from a website called dataminingbook.com. The name of the dataset is GermanCredit
## Environment
I have used Jupyter Notebook, you can use google colab as well.

## Dataset Description
